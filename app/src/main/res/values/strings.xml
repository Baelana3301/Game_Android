    <string name="rules_text">- A field of 8 by 10 cells is given. \n\n- Within one turn, the player can perform two actions: move around the field - one square around himself, and attack the enemy.\n\n- Defeating opponents and then clearing the field from dead bodies earns the player points.\n\n- If the opponent and the player are opposite to each other at a distance, then the player can strike using ranged combat.\n\n- If the player is on the next cell from the enemy, he can strike using melee, which causes double damage to the enemy.\n\n- It takes two distance attacks or one melee to defeat an enemy. But beware of the opponents because they can kill you in one attack.\n\n- As the moves go by, more enemies will start appearing on the field. The game will end when the player runs out of health.</string>
